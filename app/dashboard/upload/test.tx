Step 1: Encourage Open Reporting - By doing this, we can normalize raising concerns without fear of backlash. Team members can submit concerns via
meetings with the manager, anonymous form in the team’s SharePoint, or on dedicated team channels

Step 2: Acknowledge concerns - We can classify and respond to concerns within 48 hours by categorizing issues according to its severity. These issues should be acknowledged personally so that the issuer will feel like he/she is being attended to personally.

Step 3: Collaborative Problem-Solving - This will resolve issues with input from affected parties by facilitating a solution workshop with relevant stakeholders. In the case of team conflicts, managers should mediate within the conflict using the company's Staff Code of Conduct 

Step 4: Following Up - This is to make sure that the conflict is resolved and to prevent recurrence. We could document outcomes in a Team Concerns Log for future reference on what actions must be done to action quickly, verbally communicate updates, and review the reports quarterly in team debriefs
